# Unit-1-The-Number-Guessing-Game

Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to Pick a number between some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10"? Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.

Build a console number guessing game that prompts a player to choose a number between a specified range of numbers. After the user guesses the correct number, display the number of attempts it took them to guess correctly.

**How the program works**
* Made sure the script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
* As a player of the game, they should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.
* As a player of the game, they should be continuously prompted for a guess until they get it right.
* As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess they should be told if their answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that they can narrow down their guesses.
* As a player of the game, after the game ends they should be shown their number of attempts at guessing.
