# Unit-1-The-Number-Guessing-Game

Build a console number guessing game that prompts a player to choose a number between a specified range of numbers. After the user guesses the correct number, display the number of attempts it took them to guess correctly.

**How the program works**
* Made sure the script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
* As a player of the game, they should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.
* As a player of the game, they should be continuously prompted for a guess until they get it right.
* As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess they should be told if their answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that they can narrow down their guesses.
* As a player of the game, after the game ends they should be shown their number of attempts at guessing.
